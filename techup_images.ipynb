        "\n",
        "- We pose the question the the Chat:\n",
        "    - Write Python code to run in Google Colab that goes through a folder of images in my Google Drive. The images are the banner pictures on social media of politicians. The folder in which my images sit is called ep_member_banner_img and is in the root or main directory. If an image name contains _f_ it is female and if _m_ it is male politician. I want you to try to learn to classify male and female images. You can suggest a library of package. I want you to look at 80 per cent of images, saving some for training/prediction. I want u to create a file with the results (describe the structure) and I want you to evaluate the accuracy\n",
        "\n",
        "- It gave the following code which:\n",
        "\t- It mounts Google Drive to access your image folder, imports standard libraries: torch, torchvision, PIL → used for building and training the neural network, pandas and sklearn → used for analyzing results and saving them neatly.\n",
        "\t- Defines the folder with images and where to save the output file (predicted_labels.tsv).\n",
        "\t- This is a small “helper” class (GenderDataset) that: finds all the .jpg, .jpeg, .png files in the folder, reads the label from the filename: _f_ means female → label = 0, _m_ means male → label = 1, anything else → unknown (-1, ignored during training), loads each image in color (RGB), applies optional image transformations (like resizing and normalization), returns the image, its label, and the filename when requested. This class lets PyTorch handle images efficiently during training.\n",
        "\t- Transformations, Before feeding images to the model, they’re resized to 224×224 pixels, converted to a PyTorch tensor, normalized (this just helps the model train better by scaling pixel values).\n",
        "\t- Creates the full dataset, keeps only images that actually have _f_ or _m_ in the filename, splits those into: 80% for training (to teach the model), 20% for testing (to check how well it learned), wraps them into “data loaders” that feed small batches (16 at a time) into the model — this makes training faster and less memory-intensive.\n",
        "\t- Loads a pre-trained ResNet-18 model — a popular CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) originally trained on millions of images, sets up: a loss function (CrossEntropy) to measure how wrong predictions are, an optimizer (Adam) to adjust the model’s weights, moves everything to GPU (cuda) if available, for speed, a third loader (all_loader) is used later to get predictions for all images.\n",
        "\t- Runs for 3 full passes (epochs) through the training data, for each batch of images: sends them to the model, gets predictions, calculates the loss (how far off the guesses were), adjusts the model to improve performance, after each epoch, it prints a simple “done” message, this is the learning phase — the model gradually figures out what distinguishes male vs. female politicians’ images.\n",
        "\t- Turns off training mode and checks the model on the test set (the 20% of images it hasn’t seen), collects predictions and compares them to the true labels, Calculates: Accuracy → percentage of correct predictions, F1 score → a balance between precision and recall, Prints a detailed classification report showing results for each class (female/male)\n",
        "\t- Now it uses the trained model to classify every image in the folder — even those without _f_ or _m_ in the name, for each image it records: Filename Model’s predicted label (0=female, 1=male), True label if known (or blank if not labeled), Whether that image was used during training (seen_in_training=1 or 0), Then it saves everything into a tab-separated file (predicted_labels.tsv) on Google Drive.\n",
        "\n",
        "- This takes a few minutes to run, it shows that male politicians can be predicted F1 score of 70 per cent but female not so much (generally F1 more than 70 is considered not bad). More generally, the message is that political communication *is* gendered - and invites us to figure out why or how\n",
